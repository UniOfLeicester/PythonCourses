    "MathWorks, the company who makes Matlab, used to use the Jet colormap (and so did Matplotlib before version 2.0.)  This colormap was so popular (and pretty,) it became the default in most packages.  Unfortunatelly, Jet is a terrible colormap. Recently, there has been a lot of research about the effects of different colormaps on our perception of data that has shown how truly awful the Jet colormap is.  In [one recent study](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/papers/2011/borkin11-infoviz.pdf), physicians who were switched from Jet to a perceptually 'appropriate' map showed a 47% increase in the ability to detect potential sites of coronary artery disease.\n",

    "Because Jet was so bad, Mathworks changed their default map to one called *parula*, which is much better, but still not ideal.  Matplotlib has gone for a map called *viridis* which is perceptually uniform, looks the same if you have red-green colour blindness, and prints nicely in black and white.\n",
